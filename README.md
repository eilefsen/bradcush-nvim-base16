# Fork

This repo was forked for the sole purpose of changing the identifier hlgroup to a white base color. I simply can't stand red identifiers.

# Base16 Neovim

*Important: This repository was recently renamed from `base16-nvim` to
`nvim-base16` as most Vim and Neovim plugins follow this convention. Please
update your references accordingly, sorry for any inconvenience.*
